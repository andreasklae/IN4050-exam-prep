# 📐 Formula Recognition Questions

## New Topic Added: "Formulas & Math Foundations"

A complete topic dedicated to testing your understanding of mathematical formulas used in AI and Machine Learning!

## Why Formula Questions?

Many exam questions test whether you can:
- ✅ Recognize formulas and their purposes
- ✅ Understand what each symbol represents
- ✅ Know when to apply which formula
- ✅ Differentiate between similar formulas

## Formula Topics Covered

### Neural Networks
1. **Weighted Sum**: z_j^[k] = Σ(w_ij^[k] × a_i^[k-1])
2. **Activation**: a_j^[k] = g(z_j^[k])
3. **ReLU**: ReLU(x) = max(x, 0)
4. **ReLU Derivative**: ReLU'(x) = 1 for x > 0, 0 for x < 0

### Loss Functions
5. **MSE**: (1/N) × Σ(t_j - y_j)²
6. **Cross-Entropy**: L_CE = -Σ t_j log(y_j)

### Multi-Class Classification
7. **Softmax**: y_j = e^(z_j) / Σe^(z_k)

### Optimization
8. **Gradient Ascent**: x^(k+1) = x^(k) + γ∇f(x^(k))
9. **Gradient Descent**: x_(i+1) = x_i - γf'(x_i)
10. **Weight Update**: w_ij = w_ij - η × ∂L/∂w_ij

### Evaluation Metrics
11. **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP)
12. **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN)

### Evolutionary Algorithms
13. **Mutation**: x'_i = x_i + N(0, σ)
14. **Intermediate Recombination**: z_i = α×x_i + (1-α)×y_i
15. **Arithmetic Crossover**: Child = α×parent1 + (1-α)×parent2

### Regularization
16. **L1 Regularization**: R(w) = Σ|w_i|
17. **L2 Regularization**: R(w) = Σw_i²

### Other Important Formulas
18. **Perceptron Activation**: f(x) = 1 if Σw×x+b ≥ 0, else 0
19. **Delta (Backpropagation)**: Error signals for weight updates
20. **Chain Rule**: df(g(x))/dx = (df/dg) × (dg/dx)

## Question Format
